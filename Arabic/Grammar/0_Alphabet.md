The Arabic alphabet, or the **Arabic abjad**, is the Arabic script.   

An **abjad** is a writing system in which only consonants are represented by letter signs, leaving the vowels to be inferred by the reader (unless represented otherwise, such as by diacritics).  

A **diacritic** (also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent) is a glyph added to a letter or to a basic glyph.  

This contrasts with alphabets that provide graphemes for both consonants and vowels.    

It is a unicameral script written from right-to-left in a cursive style, and includes 28 letters, of which most have contextual forms.  

Arabic is unicameral.   

The Arabic alphabet is an abjad, with only consonants required to be written (though the long vowels – ā ī ū – are also written, with letters used for consonants); due to its optional use of diacritics to notate vowels, it is considered an impure abjad.  

There are two main collating sequences ('alphabetical orderings') for the Arabic alphabet: Hija'i, and Abjadi.  

The Hija'i order is the more common order and it is used when sorting lists of words and names, such as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries.  

The original Abjadi order derives from that used by the Phoenician alphabet and, therefore, resembles the sequence of letters in Hebrew and Greek.   

Letters are also assigned numerical values (abjad numerals) for purposes of numerology, as is done in Hebrew gematria and Greek isopsephy.   

Letters in the Hija'i order are not considered to have numerical values.   

ذ    -    da   
ذو   -    zuu
د ي  -    dii
وا    -   wii	
ي    -    ya
