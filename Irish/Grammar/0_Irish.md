##  Irish  

Irish (Standard Irish: Gaeilge), also known as Irish Gaelic or simply Gaelic, is a Celtic language of the Indo-European language family that belongs to the Goidelic languages and further to Insular Celtic, and is indigenous to the island of Ireland.  

It was the first language of the majority of the population until the 19th century, when English gradually became dominant, particularly in the last decades of the century, in what is sometimes characterised as a result of linguistic imperialism.
