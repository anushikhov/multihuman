### Korean  

Korean is the national language of both North Korea and South Korea.  

In the south, the language is known as **Hangugeo** (South Korean: 한국어) and in the north, it is known as **Chosŏnŏ** (North Korean: 조선어).  

Korean uses the **Hangul** alphabet.  

Beyond Korea, the language is recognized as a minority language in parts of China, namely Jilin, and specifically Yanbian Prefecture, and Changbai County.  

It is also spoken by Sakhalin Koreans in parts of Sakhalin, the Russian island just north of Japan, and by the Koryo-saram in parts of Central Asia.  

The language has a few extinct relatives which—along with the Jeju language (Jejuan) of Jeju Island and Korean itself—form the compact **Koreanic language family**.  

Even so, Jejuan and Korean are not mutually intelligible.  

The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in contemporary Manchuria.  

The hierarchy of the society from which the language originates deeply influences the language, leading to a system of speech levels and honorifics indicative of the formality of any given situation.  

Modern Korean is written in the Korean script (한글; Hangeul in South Korea, 조선글; Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea), an alphabet system developed during the 15th century for that purpose, although it did not become the primary script until the mid 20th century (Hanja and mixed script were the primary script until then).  

The script uses 24 basic letters (jamo) and 27 complex letters formed from the basic ones.
