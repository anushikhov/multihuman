Bonjour, comment ça va?

Ça va très bien, et toi?

Au revoir, Marie.

## Accents   

In French, an accent mark over a letter can make a new sound.  
je as in petition  
journée similar to bay  
très as in bet  

If the last letter of a word is an e (without an accent!) it's usually silent.  
femme, bonne nuit
