Swahili, also known as Kiswahili, is a **Bantu** language originally spoken by the Swahili people, who are found primarily in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (along the East African coast and adjacent littoral islands).   

Estimates of the number of Swahili speakers, including both native and second-language speakers, generally range from 150 million to 200 million.  

**Around 40% of Swahili vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords,** including the name of the language (سَوَاحِلي sawāḥilī, a plural adjectival form of an Arabic word meaning 'of the coasts').   

Swahili also has a significant number of loanwords from Portuguese, English and German.   

The Arabic loanwords date from the era of contact between Arab slave traders and the Bantu inhabitants of the east coast of Africa, which was also the time period when **Swahili emerged as a lingua franca in the region.**    

Due to concerted efforts by the governments of Tanzania and Kenya, Swahili is one of three official languages (alongside English and French) of the East African Community (EAC) countries, which are Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is the lingua franca of other areas in the African Great Lakes region and East and Southern Africa.
