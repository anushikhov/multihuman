Writing system - Latin (Hawaiian alphabet) and **HAwaiian Braille**  

Hawaiian Braille is the braille alphabet of the Hawaiian language. It is a subset of the basic braille alphabet supplemented by an additional letter ⠸ to mark long vowels.  

Hawaiian Braille uses the apostrophe, whice behaves as punctuation rather than as a consonant.  

_In 1896, the Republic of Hawaii passed Act 57, an English-only law which subsequently banned Hawaiian language as the medium of instruction in publicly funded schools and promoted strict physical punishment of children caught speaking the Hawaiian language in schools._  

_Hawaiian language was not allowed to be used in public schools for 91 years. English essentially displaced Hawaiian on six of seven inhabited islands._
